# To Do List Manager

This is a to-do list manager with animation effects. users can create tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. Each user gets their own todo list stored as a single linked list.

## Features
- **User Management**: add users, each with their own task list.
- **Task Management**: add, complete, and delete tasks.
- **Animations**: A character runs across the screen before the logo slides in and stays centered.
- **GUI**: UI built with Java Swing (with help from ChatGPT).

## How It Works
1. Users are stored in an array.
2. Each user has a unique name and a task list (single linked list).
3. Tasks have descriptions and a status (Pending/Done).
4. The GUI lets users manage their tasks easily.
5. A runner animation plays once before the logo slides in.
